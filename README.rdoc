= Write Ruby. Run JavaScript. The new Red is here.

Red takes the Ruby you write and turns it into JavaScript for your browser.

The all-new Red is a Ruby-to-JavaScript transliterator backed by a custom ruby.js library designed to let your code run in the browser exactly the way Ruby would run on your machine. The JavaScript output is optimized to contain only the fraction of the ruby.js source library needed to run your code.

What does this mean for todayâ€™s Ruby developer? Simple. You don't need to learn JavaScript.

=== Installation

To get Red working, install the rubygem.

  sudo gem install red
